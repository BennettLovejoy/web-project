	<h1>My Community Map</h1>
    <p>My name is Bennett Lovejoy and I am a data-driven policy analyst. I made this website so that young scholars, teachers, administrators, citizens, researchers, and policymakers alike can interact with data about their community. The first part of this project focused on economic and social indicators of community wellness. <strong>On the map below you can click between various layers of the map to see data about Ohio.</strong>

This data was obtained by the United States Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics. </p>
